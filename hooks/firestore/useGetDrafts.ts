### Requesting up to..
${stream.request.usdc} $USDC / month
${stream.request.krause} $KRAUSE / month
Paid bimonthly for 2 months. Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point. Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.
---
### Scope of Work
A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:
${stream.description}
---
### Specification
This contributor may submit a request for up to the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.
### Intention
This is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.
We prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving them the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community. We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.
### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUÃ§h
Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused. In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future. We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.`;
